# Message-Decryption
In this project I was tasked with decrypting an encrypted message. 

Tools used Linux Bash

I first used the ls command to list the files in the current working directory:

Proceeded with opening the README.txt file using the CAT command:

 Next used the cd command to change to the caesar subdirectory of my home directory, next used the ls -a command 
 to list all files, including hidden files, in your home directory:

Proceeded to use the cat command to open the hidden file:

*Note the data appears to be scrambled that is because it was encrypted using a ceasar cypher

To decrypt the cypher I used the following code:

With the output given I then returned to my home directory using the cd command followed by ~

Used the ls command to make sure the message was now available:

Finally opened the mmessage using de cat command:

Summary; I was tasked with decrypting a message and was able to do it succesfully.
